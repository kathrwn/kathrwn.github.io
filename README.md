## Hiya !
### Bienvenue !!
#### ようこそ !!!

Hi, I'm Kathryn.[^note] I'm, well, a lot of things. Like...

- A communications manager [^1] [^2]
- A data analyst and visualizer [^3]
- A disinformation researcher [^4]
- A graphic designer [^5]
- A writer [^6] [^7] [^8]
- And a _Jeopardy!_ champion [^9]

But recently one other thing I am is a :sparkles:programmer:sparkles: which is probably why you're here. Below you'll find a list of my projects, organized by discipline. I am currently learning Python and JavaScript, have experience in HTML and CSS (RIP Tumblr), and am also working on some more technical projects like making a painting that plays music. 

Without further ado... the projects...

### Data analysis + data viz
- [Just how far does Bryson DeChambeau swing?](https://github.com/kathrwn/brysondechambeau/blob/main/bryson%20dechambeau.ipynb) :golfing:

### Using APIs
