  <p>I'm Kate!</p>
  <p>I'm a digital native with a penchant for finding the origins of online rumors and disinformation campaigns. I'm also interested in using data-oriented network analysis to identify, track, and combat online disinformation. Interested in extremism in “feminine” internet spaces like fandom, mom’s forums, and eating disorder communities. </p>

<p>I have written previously about influencer to extremism pipelines, decaying trust in internet personalities, and the role of video games in military recruitment. My work has been featured in <i>Responsible Statecraft</i>, <i>Inkstick Media</i>, <i>Sunstroke</i>, and more.</p>

<p>I also make interactive data visualizations for serious (nuclear arsenals) and fun (mapping the population of Pokemon regions) issues.
