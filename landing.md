## Hiya !

Hi, I'm Kathryn.[^note] I'm, well, a lot of things. Like...

- A communications manager [^1] [^2]
- A data analyst and visualizer [^3]
- A disinformation researcher [^4]
- A graphic designer [^5]
- A writer [^6] [^7] [^8]
- And a _Jeopardy!_ champion [^9]

But recently one other thing I am is a :sparkles:programmer:sparkles: which is probably why you're here. Below you'll find a list of my projects, organized by discipline. I am currently learning Python and JavaScript, have experience in HTML and CSS (RIP Tumblr), and am also working on some more technical projects like making a painting that plays music. 

Crucially, I want to note that this page is a constant work in progress. My 2022 resolution is to take on a programming challenge every month, so visit often for best results. Thanks! <3

Without further ado, the projects:
